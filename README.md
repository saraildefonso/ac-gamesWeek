# ac-gamesWeek
Group Project made in one week, with Java, a simple game

This is a simple game project developed by a group of 5 people, during a bootcamp, in "Games Week", 
with only 3/4 weeks of Java programming experience.
We used Java and a library, Simple Graphics library, that was provided by the bootcamp. 
The game involves catching some objects (git-logo) to earn points while avoiding 
other object (slack.zip-logo) that can take away points and potentially "kill" the player.

Thanks to my group:
